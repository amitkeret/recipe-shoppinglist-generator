# recipe-shoppinglist-generator


## Solves two problems
1. I go shopping and do not know, which ingredients I should by - I always forget which recipes/meals I can cook.
2. I am at home and I want to cook a certain meal, but I do not have all the necessary ingredients.

## Input
* Add / edit / delete recipes.
* Select the meals you want to cook.

## Output
Accumulated list with ingredients you need to buy in order to cook the selected meals.
The ingredient list is sorted by supermarket departments.

Workflow: Copy the shopping list into memories (Mac), Wunderlist or any other tool that helps you during your shopping trip.

Recipe explainations can be concise, because the contained recipes are your own recipes you know very well.
